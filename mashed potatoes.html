                        <p>mashed taters, colloquially known as mash (British English),[2] is a dish made by mashing boiled potatoes, usually with added milk, butter, salt and pepper. It is generally served as a side dish to meat or vegetables. When the potatoes are only roughly mashed, they are sometimes called smashed potatoes. Dehydrated instant mashed potatoes and frozen mashed potatoes are available. Mashed potatoes are an ingredient in other dishes, such as dumplings and gnocchi.
                            One French variation adds egg yolk for pommes duchesse or Duchess potatoes; piped through a pastry tube into wavy ribbons and rosettes, brushed with butter and lightly browned. Pomme purée (potato puree) uses considerably more butter than normal mashed potato - up to one part butter for every two parts potato.[3][6] In low-calorie or non-dairy variations, milk, cream and butter may be replaced by soup stock or broth.

Aloo Bharta, an Indian sub-continent variation, uses chopped onions, mustard (oil, paste or seeds), chili pepper, coriander leaves and other spices. Alu Pitika (Assamese: আলু পিটিকা) is a variation of Aloo Bharta that is popular in the Indian state of Assam,[7][8] that may occasionally omit mustard and other spices. Alu Pitika using roasted and smoked potatoes is especially consumed in winters.
